<h1> AVANTHI ST THERESSA INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY</h1>
<hr/>
<p align="justified">his is the leading motto of the Training and Placement Facility of AVANTHI. Empowered with trained, certified and expert trainers the facility started functioning in the academic year 2007. Our trainers have great experience in understanding the training requirements of technical undergraduate students and design the programmes accordingly to help students attain career success year after year. Our T& P Facility aims to bridge the gap between the requirements of the corporate houses and the skill sets that the students acquire during college. In the present world largely driven by service industry, soft skills are much sought after, especially by IT companies. Very often recruiters, because of absence of these skills reject majority of the candidates. As we are all aware, the undergraduate years coincide with the most impressionable age of the students where their attitudes are developed and preference & interests formed. Therefore before stepping into the world of work students require proper initiation and the right personality. Personality enhancement programmes at our college are therefore exclusively designed to prepare entrepreneurial, learnable, employable & readily billable students.</p>
